# BASH-SCRIPTS
My Bash repo
create my bash files here on GitHub to keep the version organized.
Some notes to take into account:
* DO NOT COPY a windows file into the linux file system
* create or copy files over within the linux operating system to prevent permission issues.

My setup:
* Enable WSL on windows
* Install a distro using the server method (Windows Store is not available on Leidos Laptops)
* Install GITHub Desktop (clone REPOS to the Linux rootf directories .. seems to work with just the root directories)
* Install ATOM Text Editor
* Install packages:
  * platformio-ide
  * Tried installing Git-Plus (had issues connecting to GITHub.. abandoned the idea and got Github Desktop to work)
  * NOTE: after cloning a Repo into the linux subsystem it did take some time for the files to appear.
